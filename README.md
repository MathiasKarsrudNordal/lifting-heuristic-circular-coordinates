## **Lifting Cocycles: From Heuristic to Theory**
---

**Repository Structure**

```bash
├─ figs       # Figures generated for the article
├─ notebooks  # Contains example of algorithm 1 in practice (Example 4.3)
├─ scripts    # Scripts to reproduce plots and results
└─ src        # Reusable functions and logic
```

**Get Started**

Clone the repository and activate the Julia environment.
```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```

Scripts in `scripts/` are provided to regenerate the figures from the paper. Figures are written to the `figs/` directory by default.
